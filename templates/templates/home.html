I'm Ulises Pérez, I'm excited to introduce you to the app I've built – a Habit Tracker designed to empower users to enhance their daily routines and achieve their goals. I built this app as a University proyect on which the main goal was to master Python programming, which is why I mainly focused on the backend part of the app and only did the essential for the frontend. 

During the development of the app I combined Flask, MySQL, HTML, and CSS. This app enables users to track their habits, customize periodicity, and maintain streaks.The app adapts to varying time frames, ensuring precision in habit tracking.

My journey in building this app has allowed me to deepen my understanding of database utilization and management, mastering Python's Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts and practice html and CSS (although CSS is not my passion).
